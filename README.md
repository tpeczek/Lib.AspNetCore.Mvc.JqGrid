# Lib.AspNetCore.Mvc.JqGrid

A set of libraries which provide support for jqGrid usage in ASP.NET Core.

This is ASP.NET Core version of jqGrid related functionality from [Lib.Web.Mvc](https://github.com/tpeczek/Lib.Web.Mvc/).

- **Lib.AspNetCore.Mvc.JqGrid.Infrastructure** - Constants, enums etc. shared by all libraries.
- **Lib.AspNetCore.Mvc.JqGrid.Core** - The core functionality. If you prefer to write your own JavaScript instead of using strongly typed helper, but you still want some support on the server side for requests and responses this is what you want.
- **Lib.AspNetCore.Mvc.JqGrid.DataAnnotations** - Custom data annotations which allow for providing additional metadata when working with strongly typed helper.
- **Lib.AspNetCore.Mvc.JqGrid.Helper** - The strongly typed helper.

*This project is currently in pre-alpha status. Only part of the functionality has been migrated.*
